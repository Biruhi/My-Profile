        <section id="about" class="content">

            <h2>Background</h2>

            <p>I graduated from Debre Tabor University with a degree in Civil Engineering, where I studied structural analysis, foundation engineering, structural design, soil mechanics, highway engineering, mathematics, statistics, and related essential courses. I furthered my education with an MSc degree from Addis Ababa Science and Technology University in Civil Engineering, majoring in Road and Transportation Engineering. My studies focused on transportation planning, transportation engineering, pavement engineering, and traffic safety. With over five years of teaching experience at Debre Tabor University, I have a strong academic foundation and practical knowledge in these areas.</p>

            <h2>Skills</h2>

            <p>I possess a diverse skill set, including programming, data analytics, machine learning, and web development. My programming skills enable me to write efficient code for various applications. I am proficient in data analytics, which allows me to interpret and derive meaningful insights from complex datasets. My machine learning expertise includes the development and application of algorithms to solve real-world problems. In web development, I am skilled in creating and optimizing websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.</p>

            <h2>Research Work</h2>

            <p>My research work encompasses several notable projects. I have applied artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) value of waste glass and eggshell-stabilized black cotton soil, and utilized coffee husk for the stabilization of expansive soilâ€”both of which have been published. Additionally, I am working on predicting soil cohesion using ANN and Random Forest techniques.</p>

            <h2>Community Service</h2>

            <p>I have actively contributed to community service through various organizations. My efforts include mentoring Bahidra City civil servants on waste management and its industrial applications, assessing the impact of waste on ditches and its flood effects in Debre Tabor City, and conserving landscapes through tree planting and protection against hazards. I have motivated individuals with disabilities regarding infrastructure usage, mentored Debre Tabor University academic staff on the impact of AI in the construction industry, and inspired youth about the importance of education for civilization. I am also involved in additional relevant mentoring programs, focusing on leveraging my skills to positively impact communities.</p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>

            <p>My interests lie in leveraging my background in civil engineering and my skills in programming, data analytics, machine learning, and web development to drive impactful solutions. I am passionate about integrating technology with civil engineering to enhance infrastructure design and management, and I am committed to using my expertise to contribute to sustainable development and community improvement.</p>
